## Linear Regression 

- **LinearRegression:** uses the lm() method in base r to create a linear regression model. Includes steps for evaulating the model. 
- **MultipleRegression:** uses the lm() method in base r on more than 1 input variable. 

## Logistic Regression 

- **LogisticRegressionglm():** Example from Hands on Machine Learning with R, using the glm() package. Steps to build the logistic regression model, including evaulating the preformance using a confusion matrix. 

## Evaulation 

- **ConfidenceInterval:** 
- **Correlation:** The numeric representation of a Correlation Matrix. Shows which variables are related to each other without the graphic of a Correlation Matrix. 
- **CorrelationMatrix:** Uses package ggcorrplot to determine if variables are related to one another. Helpful to run before building model to determine which variables to eliminate. 
- **TwoSampleTTest:** Is there a difference between two groups on the same variable. Example is there a difference in the purchase habits of young and old customers.
