#Files from github must be in a csv format 

#I downloaded my file from “ajpiter R ProTips West Roxbury”
#The link to the GitHub repository where I downloaded the file is [GitHub Repository] https://github.com/ ajpiter/RProTips/blob/master/Projects/WestRoxburyHomes/WestRoxbury.csv

#To save the dataset as an object, I used the following code:
WestRoxbury.df <- read.csv("https://github.com/ ajpiter/RProTips/blob/master/Projects/WestRoxburyHomes/WestRoxbury.csv") 

The original file was from Data Analytics with R
